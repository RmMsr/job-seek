# Backlog

Known gaps, not yet scheduled.

- integration: mcp server
- fetch: **`generic_listing` has no pagination.** Sopra Steria and Tieto both cap
  at exactly 10 postings (their page-1 size) — later pages are never fetched.
  (JS-driven pagination, not hyperlink pagers — needs Playwright click/scroll)
